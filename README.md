🎓 I am finishing the Chemical Engineering PhD, so you will probably see some projects involving applications in this area.

💡 I started to become interested in this area of Data Science in March 2021, and since then I have been constantly developing my technical skills.

🖥️ I'm working as postdoctoral with predictive models using machine learning applied to the oil and gas sector.

🏡 I am Brazilian.

😆 I am a very curious person, so I like to learn about many things.
